The Rust Testament
Logline: A century after the war between Heaven and Hell shattered Earth into a cosmic scrapyard, a cynical relic hunter with angelic-tech cybernetics must escort a messianic young girl across the brutal wasteland, hunted by dogmatic fallen angels, flesh-crafting demons, and the cannibalistic cults that worship the divine wreckage of their apocalyptic war.
The Concept: The Rust Testament is a post-apocalyptic epic that blends the high-octane vehicular carnage of Mad Max with the dark, Gnostic fantasy of Diablo. The aesthetic is "divine decay." The world is a vast, rust-colored desert littered with the colossal, petrified remains of angelic war machines, demonic leviathans, and the skeletal architecture of a war fought on a scale humanity could not comprehend. Society has reformed into isolated, fortified city-states or nomadic tribes, all centered around the scavenging of "relics"—shards of angelic armor, demonic bones, and the strange technologies left behind.
The animation is gritty and textured, emphasizing the scale of the dead titans that litter the landscape. The color palette is washed-out ochres and greys, punctuated by the blinding energy of angelic tech or the sickly green glow of demonic corruption. This isn't a world of good versus evil; it's a world about surviving the collateral damage of a war between two equally terrifying, alien forces.
The Characters:
Eve: A former soldier from a forgotten war, now a lone, cynical scavenger. Her left arm and eye are cybernetic, reverse-engineered from the armor of a fallen Archangel, giving her enhanced strength and the ability to see energy signatures. She is haunted by her past and lives by a simple code: the contract is everything. She drives a heavily armored, souped-up muscle car called "The Penance."
Ana: A quiet, enigmatic ten-year-old girl with no memory of her past. She possesses a miraculous ability: she can purify radiation, heal wounds, and make plants grow in the toxic soil with a touch. She is the story's moral compass, her innocence a stark contrast to the brutal world around her.
Legate Valerius (The Angel): A commander of the Choir of Steel, a legion of angels who were stranded on Earth after the war. His wings are broken, his armor is scarred, and his faith has curdled into cruel, unwavering dogma. He believes Ana is a "Spark of the Creator," a tool that can be used to reignite the war and finally achieve victory for Heaven. He is terrifyingly serene in his violence.
The Flesh-Lord Gremory (The Demon): A powerful demonic entity who has carved out a fiefdom in the wastes. He is a master of bio-mechanics, grafting demonic flesh onto salvaged technology. He rules over a horde of surgically altered cultists and monstrous war-beasts. He sees Ana not as a messiah, but as a source of pure, raw creation energy—a living battery he can use to transform the Earth into a new Hell.
The Rust Testament: Season 1 Episode Guide
Episode 1: "A Piece of Heaven"
Eve is mid-job, scavenging a power core from the chest cavity of a derelict, miles-long Cherubim warship half-buried in the sand. The job goes south when rival scavengers—a feral tribe of cannibals—attack. A brutal, high-speed car chase and firefight ensues, showcasing Eve's ruthless efficiency and her cybernetic abilities. She successfully delivers the core to a fortified outpost and is given her next job by a shadowy client: transport a small, valuable package from a remote convent to the neutral city-state of Concord. The "package" is Ana.
Episode 2: "The Shepherd and the Lamb"
The journey begins. Eve is cold and professional, treating Ana like cargo. Ana’s gentle nature slowly chips away at Eve’s hardened exterior. While camping for the night, they are attacked by a pack of "Hell-Hounds"—demonic, hyena-like beasts. Eve is wounded, her vehicle is damaged. Ana, seeing Eve in pain, touches her wound, and it heals instantly, leaving clean flesh where there was a gaping hole. Eve is shocked and terrified, realizing this is no ordinary job.
Episode 3: "Hymn of Steel"
Legate Valerius and his squadron of Choir of Steel angels descend upon the convent, finding it empty. Through brutal interrogation of the surviving nuns, he learns of Eve and Ana. He sees this as a divine test. He and his soldiers, riding sleek, angelic-tech skiffs, begin their hunt. They catch up to Eve and Ana in a vast salt flat. Eve is completely outmatched by their speed and power. She only survives by driving The Penance into a narrow, treacherous canyon where the skiffs cannot follow.
Episode 4: "The Devil's Bargain"
With The Penance damaged and the Choir hunting them, Eve has no choice but to seek help in "Golgotha," a wretched hive of a city built around the crashed engine of a demonic titan, which still pulses with corrupting energy. The city is ruled by information brokers and mechanics who deal in forbidden tech. To get the parts she needs, Eve has to enter a gladiatorial death-race in the city's arena against other scavengers in their war-rigs. She wins, but her use of angelic tech attracts the attention of the Flesh-Lord Gremory's spies.
Episode 5: "The Whispering Engine"
While Eve works on the car, Ana wanders into the heart of Golgotha—the pulsing demonic engine. The corrupting energy doesn't harm her; instead, the engine quiets, its sickly green glow softening. The city's demonic overlords and cultists are terrified and enraged by this. They believe she is an agent of Heaven sent to destroy their power source. Eve must fight her way through a mob of mutated citizens to get Ana out of the city as it descends into chaos.
Episode 6: "Relics of the Fall"
Fleeing both the Choir and Gremory's forces, they take shelter in an ancient, pre-war library buried beneath the sand. It’s a quiet, character-driven episode. Eve reveals a piece of her past: she fought in the "Purity Wars" for a city-state that was ultimately "cleansed" by the Choir of Steel for harboring demonic refugees. She carries immense guilt. Ana, exploring the library, finds a picture book of the world before the war—green trees, blue oceans—and begins to understand what has been lost.
Episode 7: "The Flesh-Forge"
Gremory, tired of chasing, sets a trap. He has his forces take a small settlement hostage, knowing Eve's route will take her nearby. Eve wants to bypass it, but Ana insists on helping. They walk into an ambush. Eve is captured and Ana is taken by Gremory. Eve is brought to Gremory's fortress—the Flesh-Forge—a nightmare of writhing organic technology and screaming bodies. Gremory doesn't want to kill her; he is fascinated by her angelic cybernetics and wants to "improve" her.
Episode 8: "Sympathy for the Angel"
Chained in Gremory’s lab, Eve is interrogated by the Flesh-Lord. He reveals his own origin: he was a mortal scholar who sought demonic power to survive the apocalypse. He argues that his way—forced adaptation and evolution—is the only way for humanity to thrive. Meanwhile, Valerius, tracking Gremory, assaults the Flesh-Forge. The fortress becomes a massive battleground between angels and demons. In the chaos, Eve breaks free, her single goal to find Ana.
Episode 9: "The Crossroads of Faith"
Eve finds Ana in a laboratory, about to be vivisected by Gremory. At the same time, Valerius corners them. The episode is a tense, three-way standoff. Valerius offers Eve amnesty if she gives him the girl. Gremory offers her power if she helps him kill the angel. Eve, remembering her past and seeing the fear in Ana's eyes, rejects them both. She fights them both off, her cybernetics pushed to their breaking point, creating a massive explosion to cover their escape.
Episode 10: "The Road to Nowhere"
Eve and Ana escape the collapsing Flesh-Forge in a stolen, demonic-tech vehicle. Valerius and a wounded Gremory emerge from the wreckage, now with a personal, burning hatred for Eve. The contract is broken, the destination of Concord is meaningless. Eve now has a new purpose: protect this child. The season ends with them driving off into the vast, unknown wasteland, the two most powerful beings in the region hunting them. They are no longer running to something; they are running from everything, with only a sliver of hope for a future Ana might one day be able to create.
