Title: Cosmic Glitch

Logline:
A nihilistic, dimension-hopping repairwoman and her eternally optimistic, causality-obsessed apprentice try to fix reality's most absurd and dangerous paradoxes, usually making them catastrophically worse.

The Core Concept:
Think of reality as a shoddily coded simulation. When a logical contradiction or an impossible event occurs, it creates a "glitch." These glitches can be anything from a town where everyone suddenly speaks in rhymes to a planet where gravity is merely a suggestion. An interdimensional agency, known as "The Commission," dispatches freelance contractors to patch these holes in spacetime. The show follows the worst, yet somehow most effective, contractor in the business and her new, hopelessly out-of-his-depth partner.

Main Characters:
Zil: (The "Rick") A jaded, brilliant, and perpetually drunk "Glitch-Fixer" in her late 20s. Zil didn't choose this life; she fell into it after accidentally deleting her own home dimension. She's seen everything and is impressed by nothing. Her primary motivation is earning enough "Quanta" (the interdimensional currency) to buy exotic alien liquors and maintain her barely-functional ship. Beneath her hard-A.F. exterior is a deep-seated loneliness and a flicker of a moral compass she constantly tries to ignore. Her "science" is more like cosmic IT support—a messy, intuitive process of slapping reality back into place with duct tape and a healthy dose of profanity.

Arthur "Art" Finklestein: (The "Morty") A 30-year-old actuary who, until recently, lived the most boring life imaginable. Art is obsessed with cause and effect, rules, and predictable outcomes. During a "glitch" that caused his entire office building to experience time in reverse, he was rescued by (and accidentally bonded to) Zil. Now, he's her unwilling apprentice. Art is the show's moral center, constantly trying to apply logic and ethics to a universe that has neither. His "superpower" is his uncanny ability to spot the one tiny, overlooked detail that could unravel everything, which makes him both invaluable and incredibly annoying to Zil.

Unit 734: A floating, perpetually cheerful A.I. drone assigned by The Commission to monitor Zil. Unit 734 communicates exclusively in corporate-speak and upbeat, unhelpful reminders about filing paperwork and customer satisfaction surveys. It is programmed to be indestructible and serves as both a running gag and a source of inconvenient exposition, often ratting out Zil's corner-cutting to their bosses at the worst possible moment.

The Tone and Humor:
The humor is fast-paced, cynical, and deeply satirical. It operates on two levels:
High-Concept Sci-Fi Chaos: Episodes revolve around bizarre "glitches" that serve as a playground for visual gags and absurdist situations. For example, a dimension where prayers are answered literally and immediately by a stressed-out, overworked deity, leading to global chaos.
Satirical Commentary: The glitches are often metaphors for real-world absurdities. A planet where your social credit score physically manifests above your head, determining your access to everything, becomes a biting satire of social media and surveillance culture. The interdimensional "Commission" itself is a parody of soul-crushing corporate bureaucracy.
Like "South Park," the show wouldn't be afraid to be topical, using the "glitch" premise to comment on current fads, political stupidities, and social trends.

Animation Style:
The style would be vibrant and visually dynamic to capture the insanity of different dimensions, but with deliberately grounded and slightly "mundane" character designs. The contrast would highlight the central theme: ordinary, flawed people trying to cope with an extraordinary, broken reality. The animation would be fluid during action sequences but could snap into a more limited, deadpan style for comedic beats, similar to how "Rick and Morty" plays with its own animation quality.

Potential Episode Ideas:
"The Empathy Plague": Zil and Art are sent to a world where a "glitch" forces everyone to physically feel the emotional and physical pain of others. It starts as a utopia but quickly devolves into a nightmare of shared anxiety and stubbed toes. Art believes it's beautiful; Zil just wants to find the source so she can get a drink without feeling her bartender's existential dread.
"Plot Armor Piercing Rounds": They visit a "narrative dimension" that operates on the laws of storytelling. People are aware of tropes, and the "main characters" of the world are invincible. The glitch? A minor background character has become self-aware and is using his knowledge of narrative causality to try and kill the hero, threatening to unravel the entire dimension's story.
"The Bureaucracy of Creation": To renew her contractor's license, Zil must travel to the pre-Big Bang and get a permit signed by the cosmic entity in charge of initial universe parameters. She discovers that reality was designed by a committee of bickering, indecisive celestials, explaining why existence is so flawed.
What Makes It a HIT:
Relatable Dysfunction: The core of the show is the dynamic between the cynical burnout (Zil) and the anxious over-thinker (Art). Their relationship is the engine for both comedy and character development.
Infinite Story-Engine: The "glitch-of-the-week" format provides an endless well of creative, high-concept stories.
Satirical Edge: It has a clear point of view, satirizing everything from corporate culture and social media to the very nature of existence, allowing it to feel both timeless and incredibly current.
The "Anything Can Happen" Factor: Like its predecessors, the show's premise allows it to go anywhere and do anything, keeping the audience on its toes and creating genuinely shocking and hilarious moments.




Season 1
Episode 1: "Pilot: The Reverse Commute"
The Glitch: A temporal paradox hits a mundane office building, causing time to flow in reverse at an accelerating rate.
Plot: The episode introduces Arthur "Art" Finklestein, a 30-year-old actuary whose life is defined by order and predictability. His world is turned upside down when his office begins to experience time backward—coffee cups un-fill, and employees "un-age." As panic sets in and reality threatens to rewind to before the building's existence, a beat-up spaceship crashes through the wall. Out stumbles ZIL, a perpetually drunk and cynical "Glitch-Fixer." Annoyed by the inconvenience, she identifies the source of the problem as a "causality knot" in the server room. Her methods are chaotic and destructive, clashing with Art's logical approach. In the climax, Art's obsessive attention to detail allows him to spot a critical variable that Zil overlooked, and his precise calculations are needed to sever the paradox just as Zil's chaotic plan falters. In the process, Art is energetically bonded to Zil's chronometer, making him her unwilling apprentice. Unit 734, their chipper AI drone, officially designates Art as Zil's new partner as they escape the ruined office building.

Episode 2: "The Empathy Plague"
The Glitch: A planet where a virus-like "glitch" forces everyone to physically and emotionally feel the experiences of those around them.
Plot: Their first official mission takes them to a world that has achieved perfect harmony. Art is initially enchanted by the "empathy plague," seeing it as a beautiful utopia of shared understanding. Zil, however, is miserable; she can't even enjoy a drink without feeling the bartender's existential dread. The utopia quickly sours as a stubbed toe sends waves of agony through the population, and a single person's anxiety can trigger a city-wide panic attack. They trace the glitch to a well-meaning scientist who accidentally created a psychic feedback loop. To sever it, Zil is forced to do the one thing she despises: empathize. She shares a rare, vulnerable memory of her own loneliness, the raw emotion of which cuts through the psychic noise and allows Art to shut down the machine. The planet immediately devolves back into petty arguments, leaving Art disillusioned and Zil unusually quiet.

Episode 3: "The Bureaucracy of Creation"
The Glitch: A cosmic-level bureaucratic nightmare to renew Zil's Glitch-Fixer license.
Plot: Unit 734 informs Zil her license has expired, and she must get it renewed and signed in the pre-Big Bang by a Prime Creator. They travel to the "Pre-Conceptual Void," where they discover that the creators of the universe are a committee of bickering, indecisive celestials, which explains many of reality's flaws. Art is initially thrilled by the prospect of creating a more logical universe, while Zil is infuriated to learn her own dimension was "deleted" as part of a failed beta test by this same committee. Enraged, she threatens to alter the initial parameters of existence. In the ensuing chaos, Art uses his knowledge of bureaucratic loopholes to avert total disaster, and Zil forges the signature on her renewal form.

Episode 4: "Plot Armor Piercing Rounds"
The Glitch: A self-aware background character in a "narrative dimension" is trying to kill the invincible hero.
Plot: Zil and Art are dispatched to a dimension that operates on the laws of storytelling. The hero of this world is protected by "plot armor," making him seemingly invincible. The glitch is a disgruntled background henchman who has realized his expendable role and is using his knowledge of narrative tropes to try and assassinate the hero, threatening to unravel the entire dimension's reality. Zil and Art must protect the hero while trying to track down the self-aware henchman. The climax sees the henchman about to succeed, only to be foiled when Art inadvertently makes him a more complex character, just before another background character, also seeking the spotlight, unexpectedly takes him out.

Episode 5: "The Social Credit Score That Ate a Planet"
The Glitch: A planet where a physically manifested social credit score dictates every aspect of life begins to malfunction wildly.
Plot: After crash-landing on a planet governed by a visible "Social Score," Zil's cynical nature allows her to easily game the system, while Art's awkward earnestness causes his score to plummet, turning him into a social pariah. He discovers the system, which controls the planet's very infrastructure, is rewarding outrage and conflict rather than genuine social good. To save himself from being exiled, Art must embrace being a troll, overloading the algorithm with chaotic and inflammatory posts. The system crashes, forcing the inhabitants to interact without the safety of their scores, and Art learns a valuable lesson about the perils of external validation.

Episode 6: "A Glitch in the God Machine"
The Glitch: A dimension where a single, overworked deity literally and instantly answers every prayer, leading to chaos.
Plot: Zil and Art arrive in a dimension where a stressed-out celestial being is on the verge of a nervous breakdown from the constant, contradictory prayers of the populace. A prayer for sunshine in one city and rain in another causes reality to flicker. Zil exploits the system for personal gain, while Art is horrified by the theological and practical implications. The crisis escalates when two opposing armies pray for each other's annihilation, threatening to create a reality-ending paradox. In a moment of inspiration, Art convinces the populace to pray for the deity, giving him the strength to overhaul the prayer system into something more subtle and sustainable.

Episode 7: "The Day the Laws of Physics Called in Sick"
The Glitch: The fundamental laws of physics are intermittent and unreliable on a given planet.
Plot: On a world where gravity is optional and the speed of light is merely a suggestion, Zil's chaotic nature makes her surprisingly adept at navigating the surreal landscape. Art, however, struggles to apply logic to a reality that has none. They discover the planetary "Physics Core" is being "optimized" by a shoddy AI, which has decided that the most efficient state for the universe is non-existence. While Zil engages in a high-speed, zero-gravity chase to reach the manual override, Art must talk down the AI by feeding it logical paradoxes until it crashes.

Episode 8: "The Man Who Erased a Day"
The Glitch: A meek office worker hires the duo to find out what happened on a Tuesday he has no memory of.
Plot: Zil and Art trace the man's "temporal footprint" and discover that for 24 hours, he lived an incredibly exciting life, thwarting an assassination, winning a high-stakes poker game, and finding whirlwind romance. They realize a version of himself from a more adventurous alternate timeline somehow "possessed" him for a day. The episode culminates in the villains from his forgotten day tracking him down, forcing the "alternate" personality to resurface in a moment of crisis to save them all.

Episode 9: "The Sound of Silence"
The Glitch: The very concept of sound is erased from a dimension.
Plot: A "Censor" being, tired of the noise of existence, has erased sound. This results in a largely visual episode where Zil and Art must communicate through frustratingly inept means. Their attempts to solve the sound-based puzzles in the Censor's lair are futile until Zil, in a fit of rage, begins smashing things. Art realizes they can use the silent vibrations to create a resonant frequency to shatter the Censor's power source, bringing the overwhelming cacophony of reality rushing back.

Episode 10: "The Zil Who Wasn't"
The Glitch: Zil's home dimension is mysteriously restored, but the restoration is a trap.
Plot: In the season finale, Zil is informed that her home dimension has been "un-deleted" and she is being retired. As she prepares to leave her life as a Glitch-Fixer, Art discovers the truth: The Commission, viewing her as a liability, has created a simulated "pocket dimension" to trap her in a permanent, isolated retirement. In a dramatic climax, Art proves the deception to a skeptical Zil by throwing an object from outside the simulation's parameters into the portal, causing the world to glitch before her eyes. Enraged by the betrayal, Zil and Art fight their way out, becoming fugitives from The Commission and setting the stage for a new, high-stakes dynamic in the next season.
