Characters

Jedediah: "Jed" Stone: A former preacher haunted by a past tragedy that shattered his faith. He is now a cynical, opium-addicted wanderer, his knowledge of scripture twisted into a morbid understanding of the unfolding apocalypse.

Silas: "The Skinner" Kane: A notoriously brutal bounty hunter known for his efficiency and his gruesome habit of skinning his bounties. He is pragmatic and selfish, viewing the zombie outbreak as just another opportunity.

Kaya: A young woman from a local tribe whose people have been decimated by the plague. She is a skilled tracker, herbalist, and warrior, fiercely protective of her ancestral lands.
Setting

The story is set in a remote, mountainous region of the American frontier in the late 1700s.[1] The landscape is characterized by treacherous mountain passes, dense forests, and isolated, ramshackle settlements.[2] Life for settlers in this period was harsh, often involving the construction of simple log cabins and a focus on subsistence farming.[2]

Plot Outline
Act I: The Blight
The story opens with a lone trapper being brutally attacked by what appears to be a rabid animal, but is revealed to be a grotesque, zombie-like creature.
Jedediah is introduced in a rundown frontier town, lost in an opium-fueled haze.
A mysterious illness, initially dismissed as fever, rapidly spreads through the town, turning the infected into violent, flesh-craving monsters.
Jedediah is saved from a newly turned creature by Silas, who is in town collecting a bounty.
As they escape the overrun town, they encounter Kaya, who has been observing the spread of the plague. She reveals that the affliction is affecting both humans and animals, creating monstrous hybrids. A tense alliance is formed out of necessity.
Act II: The Desperate Journey
The trio learns the hard way how to dispatch the "Blighted." These creatures are unnaturally resilient, and only decapitation or fire are truly effective.
They discover the plague has a psychological component, inducing terrifying hallucinations that prey on their deepest fears and traumas. Jedediah's opium addiction makes him particularly susceptible.
They encounter a deranged group of religious zealots who believe the plague is divine punishment and are "cleansing" the land by torturing and murdering anyone they deem sinners, infected or not.
Kaya leads them towards what she believes is the source of the plague: a vast, ancient cave system. The entrance is a grotesque, pulsating mass of organic matter.
Act III: The Heart of the Rot
The cave is a hellish labyrinth of pulsating flesh and horrific creatures. The hallucinations intensify, forcing each character to confront their inner demons.
At the heart of the cave, they discover the source of the plague: a colossal, Lovecraftian entity—a "Mother"—a writhing mass of mutated flesh and absorbed bodies, all connected to a shimmering, otherworldly crystal.
Kaya reveals that a sacred ritual, combined with a volatile herbal mixture, can destroy the crystal, but it requires a human sacrifice.
In a moment of twisted redemption, Jedediah sacrifices himself, reciting a final, defiant sermon as he plunges a ceremonial dagger into his own heart, triggering a violent reaction that destroys the "Mother."
Silas and Kaya barely escape the collapsing cave. The immediate threat appears to be neutralized, but the final shots reveal the plague is not entirely eradicated, as the black ichor from the "Mother" begins to contaminate a nearby water source, hinting at a new cycle of infection.




Redemption in Rot Flesh & Flintlock: Season 1 Plot Outlines
Here are the detailed plot outlines for the first 10-episode season of the animated series Redemption in Rot Flesh & Flintlock.

Episode 1: "The Sermon of the Scab"
The series opens on a lone trapper in the vast, unforgiving wilderness of the late 1700s American frontier. His gruesome death at the hands of a grotesquely rabid deer serves as a cold open to the unnatural horror to come. The story then introduces Jedediah "Jed" Stone in a squalid frontier town, lost in an opium-fueled haze, haunted by visions of a fire that destroyed his past. His cynical stupor is interrupted by the arrival of Silas "The Skinner" Kane, a notorious bounty hunter who has come to collect payment for a dead outlaw. Simultaneously, a mysterious and violent illness erupts within the town, turning the afflicted into flesh-craving monsters with terrifying speed. Jedediah is saved from a newly turned creature by the pragmatic Silas, who was simply clearing a path to his horse. As they make a desperate escape from the burning, overrun town, they encounter Kaya, a Native American woman who has been tracking the plague. She reveals the affliction is not limited to humans, but also affects wildlife, creating monstrous hybrids. Out of sheer necessity, a tense and fragile alliance is formed between the disgraced priest, the brutal bounty hunter, and the stoic warrior.

Episode 2: "Flintlock Baptism"
Camping in the shadow of the smoldering remains of the town, the trio's alliance is immediately tested by mutual suspicion. Their camp is attacked by a small band of the "Blighted," and they quickly learn the creatures are unnaturally resilient to conventional injuries. Silas discovers a pistol ball to the chest barely slows them, while Jedediah finds blunt force trauma equally ineffective. It is Kaya who demonstrates the only sure methods of dispatching the monsters: decapitation with her hatchet and destruction by fire. Silas, ever the pragmatist, quickly adapts these brutal lessons, saving a clumsy, withdrawal-racked Jedediah. While scavenging an abandoned log cabin typical of the era, Jedediah finds a Bible and recites a final passage over the infected dead, a fleeting glimpse of the preacher he once was.

Episode 3: "The Skinner's Price"
The group stumbles upon a freshly ransacked wagon train, a charnel house of Blighted violence. Amongst the dead, Silas discovers a bounty poster for a man he was tracking, leading him to declare his intention to travel to the isolated settlement of Fort Chastity. Jedediah argues against this, pleading for them to warn other settlements, while Kaya, though wary of the fort, agrees to go, recognizing the plague is spreading in that direction. Jedediah's opium withdrawal intensifies, plaguing him with debilitating tremors and waking nightmares of his past failures. Their journey is punctuated by a horrifying encounter with a lone survivor who turns before their eyes, forcing Silas to kill him. In a moment that highlights his cold nature, Silas immediately loots the man's corpse, earning him Jedediah's disgust and a sharp retort that sentiment is a fatal luxury in this new world.

Episode 4: "Whispers in the Wounded Wood"
As the trio ventures deeper into the mountainous terrain, the landscape itself seems to fall ill. They begin to experience terrifying psychological phenomena—disembodied whispers and auditory hallucinations that prey on their deepest traumas. Jedediah's opium-addicted mind proves especially fertile ground for this mental assault, as he is repeatedly tormented by visions of his deceased daughter. Kaya reveals that her people have long considered these lands sacred and dangerous, believing the plague is a spiritual sickness as much as a physical one. Even the hardened Silas is not immune, experiencing a silent, judgmental vision of a past bounty he killed. The episode culminates in a harrowing battle against a monstrous Blighted bear, a horrific hybrid of man and beast that forces the three to combine their skills to survive.

Episode 5: "The Gospel of Pain"
The group arrives at Fort Chastity to find it under the control of Brother Malachi, a charismatic zealot, and his fanatical followers, "The Cleansed." Malachi preaches that the plague is divine punishment, and his congregation "purifies" the land by torturing anyone they deem a sinner, whether they are infected or not. The trio are allowed entry but soon realize they are prisoners. Silas spots his bounty target acting as one of Malachi's enforcers, forcing him to navigate the dangerous internal politics of the fort. Malachi, intrigued by Jedediah's past, attempts to recruit him, preying on his broken faith and offering him opium to "commune with the angels," a temptation that both repulses and attracts the former preacher.

Episode 6: "Sacrament of Skin"
Silas concocts a plan to get to his bounty, while Kaya, disgusted by his greed, focuses on escape. She discovers a hidden map from a previous captive that points to a vast cave system, believed to be the source of the plague. Malachi heightens his psychological torment of Jedediah, forcing him to witness a brutal "cleansing" that triggers his trauma. The zealot leader then offers Silas a deal: help him capture a nearby group of natives in exchange for his bounty. In a climactic moment of decision, Silas feigns acceptance before turning on the Cleansed, setting their storehouse ablaze. Amid the chaos, Kaya frees other prisoners, and Jedediah, finding a flicker of his old conviction, publicly denounces Malachi as a false prophet before the trio escapes the fort.

Episode 7: "The Belly of the Earth"
Now fugitives from the Cleansed, the trio, along with a few other escapees, follow the map towards the cave system. The journey is a desperate race against time as they are hunted by Malachi's forces while the Blighted presence grows stronger and more organized. Kaya's ancestral knowledge of the land proves essential to their survival. They finally arrive at the cave entrance—a horrifying, pulsating maw of organic matter that seems to breathe. Steeling themselves, they descend into a living, hellish labyrinth.

Episode 8: "Echoes of the Damned"
Inside the cave, the psychological torment intensifies into vivid, waking hallucinations. The fleshy, breathing tunnels seem designed to disorient and break them. Jedediah is forced to relive the fire that killed his family, confronted by a phantasm of his former, righteous self. Silas is haunted by the sorrowful ghosts of every man he has killed for money, while Kaya must watch visions of her people being consumed by the plague. They are forced to rely completely on one another to fend off cave-dwelling horrors and navigate the mental assault, their shared trauma forging a powerful, unspoken bond.

Episode 9: "The Heart of the Rot"
The trio reaches the heart of the cave, a massive cavern containing the source of the plague: a colossal, Lovecraftian "Mother" entity—a writhing sphere of flesh and absorbed bodies connected to a shimmering, otherworldly crystal. Kaya deciphers ancient murals, realizing a sacred ritual involving a volatile herbal mixture and a human sacrifice is the only way to destroy the crystal. Their revelation is cut short by the arrival of Malachi and his remaining followers. The insane zealot, viewing the Mother as a divine being, leads his men in an attack, sparking a chaotic three-way battle between the trio, the Cleansed, and the cave's monstrous guardians.

Episode 10: "A Sermon in Sacrifice"
The final battle rages. Silas and Kaya fight with a desperate synergy, while Malachi, in a fit of religious ecstasy, allows the Mother to absorb him. Watching the chaos and seeing the bond between his companions, Jedediah finds a twisted sense of redemption. Grasping the ceremonial dagger, he walks towards the heart of the chamber and delivers a final, defiant sermon directed at the monstrous entity. With a declaration of faith in humanity's flawed resilience, he plunges the dagger into his own heart. The sacrifice triggers a violent, explosive reaction from the crystal, destroying the Mother and causing the cavern to collapse. Silas and Kaya barely escape with their lives, emerging into the dawn, forever changed by the sacrifice. In the final, ominous scene, a trickle of the Mother's black ichor is shown seeping from the rock and contaminating a nearby water source, hinting that the plague is not over, but is merely beginning a new cycle.
