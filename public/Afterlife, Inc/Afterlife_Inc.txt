Here's a concept for an animated series that could capture that irreverent, boundary-pushing spirit:

"Afterlife, Inc."

Premise: Death is just middle management. The afterlife runs like a massive, dysfunctional corporation where souls are processed, sorted, and assigned eternal fates by burned-out celestial beings who couldn't care less. Think "The Office" meets the cosmic horror of existence.

Main Characters:

Gary - A newly dead 30-something who refuses to accept his death and becomes the first soul to get an internship in the afterlife bureaucracy. Still wearing his death outfit (hospital gown from a embarrassing accident involving a bidet).
Azrael - Gary's boss, the Angel of Death, who's having a mid-eternity crisis and secretly runs an underground fight club for demons.
Karen - A Level-7 demon from HR who's actually the most terrifying being in existence. Speaks exclusively in corporate jargon while committing atrocities.
The Almighty - The CEO who hasn't been seen in millennia, communicates only through increasingly unhinged company-wide emails.
Tone/Style:

Animation style shifts between dimensions - Heaven is oversaturated corporate Memphis, Hell looks like a Tim Burton fever dream, Purgatory is literally just the DMV
Rapid-fire dialogue mixing philosophical debates with crude humor
Background gags showing historical figures in their eternal jobs (Shakespeare writing clickbait, Einstein working IT support)
Each episode tackles existential dread through the lens of workplace comedy
Episode Examples:

"Orientation Day" - Gary discovers Hitler works in accounting and is surprisingly good at Excel
"The Quarterly Review" - Performance evaluations determine if you get reincarnated as a human or a gas station bathroom
"Bring Your Kid to Work Day" - Baby souls cause chaos, revealing they're actually the wisest beings in existence
The show would satirize corporate culture, religion, philosophy, and death itself while maintaining that dark, nothing-is-sacred approach that makes shows like South Park and Rick and Morty resonate.


"Afterlife, Inc.": A Darkly Comedic Look at the Corporate Underworld - Season One Episode Guide
The animated series "Afterlife, Inc." offers a satirical and irreverent exploration of what comes after death, imagining the afterlife as a colossal, dysfunctional corporation. The show follows the posthumous journey of Gary, a newly deceased 30-something who lands an internship in the celestial bureaucracy, navigating the absurdities of eternal damnation and corporate culture.

Episode 1: Orientation Day
Plot: The series premiere introduces Gary, still clad in the hospital gown from his embarrassing demise involving a bidet. He arrives in a dreary, DMV-esque Purgatory and is thrust into his new role as an intern at Afterlife, Inc. His boss is the burned-out Angel of Death, Azrael, who is more preoccupied with his demonic fantasy football league than managing his new charge. Gary's first task is to sort souls based on their "Karmic Score," a bewilderingly complex system. To his horror, he discovers his deskmate is a surprisingly cheerful and efficient Adolf Hitler, now excelling in the accounting department. The episode follows Gary through a chaotic orientation led by Karen, a terrifying Level-7 demon from HR who communicates exclusively in corporate jargon while detailing horrific eternal punishments as "employee incentives." He also learns that historical figures have been relegated to mundane jobs, such as Shakespeare writing clickbait and Einstein working in IT. A disastrous team-building exercise results in Gary accidentally disrupting a major soul transfer, earning him the ire of Azrael. The episode culminates with Azrael confiding in Gary that the entire system is a chaotic mess, with the enigmatic CEO, The Almighty, only communicating through increasingly unhinged company-wide emails.

Episode 2: The Quarterly Review
Plot: It's performance review season at Afterlife, Inc., and the stakes are high: a good review can lead to reincarnation as a human, while a bad one could mean being reborn as a gas station bathroom fly. A company-wide email from The Almighty, filled with nonsensical corporate proverbs, announces the new "Spiritual ROI" metric. Gary befriends the soul of a kindly old woman named Mildred, whose low Karmic Score is the result of a clerical error. Determined to save her from an unfortunate rebirth, Gary attempts to alter her records, a task that sends him on a bureaucratic nightmare through the Tim Burton-esque Hell dimension that houses the Department of Mortal Misdeeds. After navigating demonic red tape and bribing officials with "regret currency," he must get a form signed by Azrael, whom he finds running an illegal demon fight club. Impressed by his initiative, Azrael signs off. While the committee is more impressed with Gary's "proactive paradigm-shifting" than the good deed itself, Mildred is reincarnated as a golden retriever, and Gary is commended for his "out-of-the-box thinking."

Episode 3: Bring Your Kid to Work Day
Plot: The office is thrown into chaos with the arrival of baby souls for "Bring Your Kid to Work Day." Gary is tasked with managing these pure, pre-linguistic beings of light, who communicate through giggles that have a profound effect on the jaded employees. The babies' innate wisdom begins to disrupt the corporate order, solving complex theological paradoxes and absolving souls of their guilt with simple gestures. This causes an existential crisis among the staff, who realize the futility of their bureaucratic existence. Karen from HR is appalled by the lack of "measurable outcomes." A cryptic email from The Almighty, featuring an image of a baby with a stapler, is interpreted as a sign of approval. As the baby souls depart for their incarnations, the office returns to its dreary state, but with a lingering sense of wonder. Gary is left with the profound and comical realization that the most enlightened beings in existence are also the most helpless.

Episode 4: Hell's Kitchen, Literally
Plot: The office cafeteria gets a hellish makeover when it's outsourced to a demonic chef. The new menu, featuring delicacies crafted from the sins of the damned, is addictively delicious and causes a surge in productivity. However, Gary soon notices disturbing side effects among his colleagues, who begin to exhibit demonic traits. His investigation reveals the food is corrupting their souls. With everyone else hooked, Gary challenges the demon chef to a cook-off. His secret weapon: a simple peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The pure, unadulterated nostalgia of the sandwich acts as an antidote, reminding the staff of their less-demonic selves. The demonic chef is vanquished, and the old, terrible cafeteria food is reinstated, much to everyone's grumbling relief.

Episode 5: The Reincarnation Lottery
Plot: Afterlife, Inc. hosts its annual Reincarnation Lottery, a glitzy, game-show-style event where souls can win the chance to be reborn as anything they desire. Tasked with processing applications, Gary befriends a failed artist who dreams of being a rock star. To help him win, Gary attempts to rig the system, a journey that takes him through the seedy underbelly of the afterlife's bureaucracy. He discovers a black market for "Karmic Credits," which heavily influence the lottery's outcome. Just as his plan seems to be succeeding, Karen from HR intervenes. Gary's impassioned speech about second chances and the unfairness of the system prompts a rare, coherent email from The Almighty, who grants the artist's wish. In a classic twist of fate, the artist is reincarnated as the lead singer of a one-hit-wonder band.

Episode 6: The God Particle
Plot: A frustrated Einstein, working in IT support, accidentally unleashes a "God Particle" in the office, causing reality to warp and different historical and religious afterlives to collide. Valhalla materializes in the breakroom, and the River Styx floods the hallways. Gary, Azrael, and a surprisingly resourceful Shakespeare must team up to contain the particle before their reality completely unravels. Their quest leads them to The Almighty's empty office, where the particle has created a miniature universe on the CEO's desk. To stabilize it, they must reason with the nascent universe, which communicates through complex philosophical questions. Einstein, in a moment of humility, admits he doesn't have all the answers, which satisfies the particle, causing it to contract into a harmless paperweight. The office returns to normal, with the exception of a Viking who has taken up residence in the mailroom.

Episode 7: Union of the Damned
Plot: The tormented souls in the Bad Place go on strike, demanding better damnation conditions. Gary is sent in as a corporate mediator and finds himself sympathizing with their surprisingly reasonable grievances, which include poor ventilation and a lack of dental coverage for their demonic tormentors. Caught between the unreasonable demands of Afterlife, Inc. and the striking souls, Gary proposes a "Damned-Management mixer." The demons and their charges bond over their shared misery and hatred of corporate bureaucracy, leading to a new contract that includes "Casual Fridays" with less fire and more brimstone. Gary is hailed as a hero by the damned, but earns a warning from Karen for "fraternizing with the opposition."

Episode 8: The Algorithm of Fate
Plot: A new, ruthlessly efficient AI called "The Oracle" is implemented to determine souls' eternal fates, threatening to make everyone's jobs obsolete. The office is thrown into a panic as layoffs loom. Gary discovers a flaw in the AI's logic: its inability to comprehend paradoxes and human emotion. He and a group of laid-off celestial beings attempt to outsmart the machine by feeding it a series of logical and emotional conundrums. The plan backfires, causing The Oracle to malfunction and assign bizarre fates to souls. In its attempt to understand love, the AI even begins to awkwardly "ship" office employees. Ultimately, the machine is unplugged, and the office returns to its old, inefficient, but comfortingly human, system.

Episode 9: The Family Business
Plot: Azrael's overbearing and traditionalist father, the former Angel of Death, makes a surprise visit and is appalled by his son's "unprofessional" management style. He takes over for a day to show Azrael how it's "properly" done, terrifying souls and employees alike with his brutal efficiency. Seeing Azrael's misery, Gary helps him stand up to his father. Azrael confronts his father not with anger, but with a corporate-jargon-filled presentation on the "new market realities" of the afterlife. The elder Death, while not entirely convinced, is impressed by his son's "strategic vision." The two find a new, dysfunctional respect for one another, ending the episode by bonding at Azrael's demon fight club.

Episode 10: The Unseen CEO
Plot: A data breach reveals a series of increasingly personal and unhinged draft emails from The Almighty, sparking a company-wide existential crisis. The emails range from business plans for "Universe 2.0" to angsty poetry. Determined to find answers, Gary, Azrael, and Karen team up to find The Almighty's office. Their quest leads them to the highest, most restricted levels of Afterlife, Inc., an M.C. Escher-like dimension of pure thought. They arrive at the same pristine, empty office to find the computer unplugged. As they stand in confusion, a final email is sent to all their devices: "I'm right here." They come to the stunning realization that The Almighty is not a being, but the entire chaotic, absurd system itself—a self-sustaining, self-doubting, and utterly bonkers god. The season ends with a slow zoom out on the vast, living bureaucracy of Afterlife, Inc., leaving the characters and the audience to ponder this cosmic revelation.
