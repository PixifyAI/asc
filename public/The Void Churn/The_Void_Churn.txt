The Void Churn
Logline: The blue-collar crew of a deep-space bio-prospecting ship, on a mission to harvest genetic material from a primordial death-world, discovers their corporate employer is a transhumanist "flesh-cult" that intends to use the alien DNA to forcibly "evolve" humanity, forcing the survivors to fight for their lives and their very definition of human against a mutating alien horror and the fanatical, surgically-altered corporate agents hidden among them.
The Concept: The Void Churn is a claustrophobic sci-fi horror series that combines the gritty, "truckers in space" realism of Alien with the grotesque body-horror of John Carpenter's The Thing and the cosmic dread of Event Horizon. The setting is the "St. Tenebra," a massive, utilitarian harvester ship. It's not a sleek vessel; it's a flying factory—greasy, loud, and labyrinthine.
The horror is twofold: the external threat of the alien, a creature of rapid, horrifying evolution, and the internal threat of paranoia, as the crew realizes their employer, Xenocorp, is not just negligent but malevolent. The cultish devotion of the hidden corporate agents, who see biological mutation as a divine ascension, adds a terrifying psychological layer. The animation is dark and atmospheric, focusing on cramped corridors, industrial decay, and visceral, wet-on-wet biological transformations.
The Characters:
Commander Eva Rostova: The ship's weary, by-the-book captain. A former military officer who took this corporate job for a quiet retirement, she is now responsible for the lives of a crew she barely knows. Her pragmatism is her greatest strength and weakness.
Jax "Wrench" Volkov: The ship's lead engineer. A cynical, foul-mouthed genius who can fix anything with duct tape and a kick. He knows every inch of the ship and is deeply suspicious of corporate authority. He is the audience's grounded, bullshit-detecting voice.
Dr. Aris Thorne: The lead xenobiologist on the science team. Ambitious, brilliant, and unnervingly fascinated by the alien life they find. He walks a fine line between scientific curiosity and obsessive fanaticism.
The Purifier / Security Chief Marcus Hale: The ship's security officer. He appears to be a stoic professional, but is secretly a high-ranking member of the Xenocorp flesh-cult. He has subtle but unnerving surgical modifications, and his job is to ensure the "ascension" proceeds as planned, with the crew as the first test subjects.
The Xylos Organism (The Churn): Not a single creature, but a hyper-adaptive genetic conglomerate. It absorbs the DNA of its victims, mimicking them, combining them, and repurposing their biomass to create ever more efficient and horrifying forms. Its goal is simple: consume, replicate, evolve.
The Void Churn: Season 1 Episode Guide
Episode 1: "The Harvest"
The St. Tenebra arrives at the primordial exoplanet Xylos. The atmosphere is thick, the landscape a teeming jungle of violent alien flora and fauna. Jax voices his concerns about the mission's rushed timeline and lack of safety protocols. An away team, led by Dr. Thorne, descends to the surface to retrieve a "specimen." The mission is tense and bloody, as they are stalked by apex predators. They manage to secure a pulsating, pod-like organism, but a team member is pricked by one of its spines during containment.
Episode 2: "Quarantine"
Back on the ship, the injured crewman is placed in med-bay quarantine. His wound begins to mutate at an alarming rate, sprouting chitinous growths. He convulses and dies, only for his chest to burst open, releasing a small, skittering creature made of his repurposed flesh. The creature escapes into the ship's ventilation system. The ship is put on full lockdown. Hale, the security chief, takes control of the situation with unsettling calm, assuring Rostova it's under control.
Episode 3: "The Second Mouth"
The crew hunts for the creature. Jax, navigating the maintenance shafts, finds gruesome evidence of its passage: pools of digestive enzymes and half-consumed ship rats that have been horribly mutated. The creature attacks a lone crew member in the mess hall, revealing it has grown significantly, now a grotesque fusion of the first victim and the rats it consumed. It demonstrates a terrifying ability to mimic sounds, luring its victim closer with the voice of a friend.
Episode 4: "The Sleepers Wake"
Rostova, trying to send a distress call, finds all external communications are being jammed—from inside the ship. Her suspicions turn to the science team. She confronts Dr. Thorne, who confesses his allegiance to Xenocorp's philosophy. He is a believer. Simultaneously, other crew members reveal themselves as "Purifiers," attacking their shipmates with hidden blades and strange bio-mechanical weapons. Hale reveals his true nature, capturing a portion of the crew for "processing."
Episode 5: "The Gospel of Flesh"
Jax and a handful of survivors are cornered in the engine room, the one place Jax can fortify. Rostova is captured and brought to Hale. He explains the "great work": humanity is stagnant, and Xenocorp believes this alien organism is a divine tool to force the next stage of evolution. The crew are not employees; they are the first flock. He shows her horrifying footage from previous failed experiments on other ships.
Episode 6: "Antibody"
Trapped and hunted by both the alien (now a hulking beast) and the corporate cultists, Jax's group decides to fight back. They realize the alien is drawn to organic matter. They start rigging traps using medical waste and food supplies to lure it. The episode is a tense cat-and-mouse game through the ship's cargo bay, as they attempt to trap the creature and study its weaknesses, culminating in them successfully severing one of its limbs for study.
Episode 7: "The Angel in the Machine"
Studying the severed limb, the survivors discover it has a vulnerability to extreme cold. Their only hope is to vent the ship's primary coolant into the life-support system, which will flash-freeze the vessel but also kill them in minutes if they can't reach sealed-off survival pods. The plan is complicated by Dr. Thorne, who sabotages them, believing their actions to be blasphemy against a perfect organism.
Episode 8: "The Red Sermon"
Rostova stages an escape, turning the tables on her captors. She gets to the bridge, intending to set the ship on a collision course with a nearby star to destroy the alien threat for good. Hale confronts her, revealing his own advanced, terrifying body modifications. Their fight is brutal and intimate, a battle of wills for the soul of the ship. Hale argues that pain and horror are the necessary catalysts for rebirth.
Episode 9: "The Churn"
All hell breaks loose. Jax's group initiates the coolant flush, sending waves of freezing gas through the corridors. The alien, now a massive, multi-limbed monstrosity incorporating a half-dozen crew members, rampages through the ship, trying to reach the warmth of the engine core. The cultists, seeing this as the moment of ascension, run towards it, offering their bodies. It’s a chaotic three-way battle between the survivors, the fanatics, and the evolving monster in the freezing fog.
Episode 10: "Human Remains"
In the final moments, Rostova manages to override Hale and trigger the ship's self-destruct sequence. Jax and a few other survivors make it to the last remaining escape shuttle. As they blast away, they see the St. Tenebra consumed by a fireball. The relief is short-lived. A warning light blinks on their shuttle's console: "Unidentified Biological Mass Detected in Life Support." They look at each other in dawning horror. A piece of the creature, or an infected survivor, made it on board with them. The season ends with the small shuttle, a coffin adrift in the vast, silent void, as a sickening, wet tearing sound is heard from a back compartment.
