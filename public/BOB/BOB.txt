BOB: Galactic Probation Officer
Logline: A well-meaning but hopelessly naive alien is sent to the cosmic equivalent of a backwater bog—Earth—on a "career-defining mission" to stop humanity from wiping itself out, armed with a cynical, disgraced mentor, faulty alien tech, and a complete misunderstanding of human nature.
Tone and Humor: The series will embrace the cynical, high-concept, and often nihilistic humor of Rick and Morty. The comedy will stem from the deconstruction of sci-fi tropes, the vast, uncaring absurdity of the cosmos, and the clash between Bob's idealistic mission and the grim, messy reality of both Earth and the wider galactic community. Expect fast-paced, dialogue-heavy scenes, morally ambiguous solutions to global problems, and moments of shocking violence contrasted with deep-seated character pathos.
Core Characters:
BOB (Bureaucratic Operations Bot - Unit 734): A young, optimistic, and textbook-smart alien from a highly ordered and emotionally suppressed society. He genuinely believes in his mission to "uplift" humanity. He sees this assignment as his chance to prove himself and climb the bureaucratic ladder. His naivete is his greatest weakness; he often tries to solve complex human issues like war or climate change with simplistic, alien "solutions" that backfire spectacularly. He's the "Morty" of the duo, but with a misguided sense of competence.
ZORP: A grizzled, disgraced, and profoundly cynical member of Bob's species, exiled to Earth decades ago for "cosmic-level insubordination" (he told the Galactic Chancellor his grand unification theory was "derivative"). He's Bob's officially assigned mentor and despises it. Zorp has spent years on Earth, subsisting on junk food, cable television, and a potent sense of cosmic irony. He sees humanity as a lost cause but is occasionally, and reluctantly, impressed by their capacity for things his own species lacks, like art, spicy food, and pointless acts of kindness. He's the "Rick," but his genius is corroded by apathy and cheap whiskey. He only helps Bob to alleviate his own boredom or to get his hands on some specific piece of Earth culture he's become obsessed with.
CHLOE: A sharp, underachieving, and perpetually unimpressed 20-something conspiracy vlogger. She's the first human to stumble upon Bob and Zorp's true nature. Instead of being shocked, she's annoyed that the "real aliens" are a clueless intern and a washed-up slacker. She gets dragged into their misadventures, often acting as the voice of reason (or at least, the voice of "that's a terrible idea, and here's why it will specifically screw me over"). She provides the grounded, human perspective on their cosmic fumbling.
The Series Concept:
The "Galactic Federation" isn't a benevolent entity; it's a bloated, indifferent bureaucracy. Earth is not a special planet; it's a "Class-7H Volatile Society" located in a cosmically inconvenient sector. If humanity triggers its own extinction through nuclear war, a grey-goo event, or by angering a dimension-hopping deity, the resulting energy blast would disrupt a major hyperspace shipping lane for weeks.
Bob has been sent not to save humanity for its own sake, but to prevent a costly logistical headache for the Federation. His mission is seen by his superiors as a low-stakes assignment for a junior officer—a cosmic equivalent of cleaning up a minor spill. They are completely unaware of the sheer, chaotic stupidity humanity is capable of.
Season 1 Plot Outline:
Episode 1: Pilot - "Probationary Planet"
Bob arrives in a cheap, malfunctioning landing pod in a suburban park. He meets Zorp, who is initially mistaken for a homeless man.
The Threat: Bob's first task is to stop a major war. He consults his alien handbook and decides the best course of action is to use a "Harmonization Ray" on the leaders of two warring nations during a UN summit.
The Twist: The ray doesn't create harmony; it's a low-budget model that links their minds into a single, petty, and now doubly-powerful hive-mind consciousness, escalating the conflict.
Resolution: Zorp and a newly-abducted Chloe have to create a fake, even bigger alien threat using a satellite dish and a stolen food truck to scare the hive-mind leaders into submission. Bob learns his first lesson: the handbook is useless.
Episode 2: "Climate of Inconvenience"
The Threat: Bob attempts to solve climate change by introducing a species of genetically engineered space lichen that devours carbon dioxide.
The Twist: The lichen is hyper-efficient, plunging a major city into a localized ice age overnight. Worse, the lichen gains sentience and, communicating through hijacked television signals, demands humanity cease all "breathing" as it finds carbon-based life offensive.
Resolution: Zorp uses his knowledge of intergalactic black markets to trade the entire sentient lichen colony to a race of silicon-based hipsters who want to use it for "organic terraforming" in exchange for a rare, vintage Earth arcade machine.
Episode 3: "Economic Anxiety & Anal Probes"
The Threat: Bob identifies economic inequality as a root cause of instability. He decides to "fix" capitalism by hacking the global financial markets and distributing all wealth equally.
The Twist: The sudden equality causes global panic, the collapse of all industry, and the rise of a barter system based on an absurd commodity (e.g., novelty socks). Conspiracy theories run rampant, and Chloe's vlog gets millions of hits, putting her in danger.
Resolution: To fix it, Zorp has to fake a classic alien abduction scenario on Wall Street, complete with anal probes, to scare everyone into thinking the "real aliens" punished them for their socialist experiment, causing a terrified rush back to traditional capitalism.
Episode 4: "Deity Ex Machina"
The Threat: A small but fervent doomsday cult is on the verge of summoning a low-level, pan-dimensional "god" that feeds on belief. While not a planet-killer, its arrival would cause "significant metaphysical paperwork" for the Federation.
The Twist: Bob tries to reason with the cult, but accidentally performs one of their rituals correctly. The god arrives and is shockingly needy and insecure, demanding constant praise and attention.
Resolution: Chloe, using her knowledge of internet trolls, goads the deity into a flame war on social media. The god's fragile ego is shattered by the sheer volume of online hate, and it retreats to its own dimension in tears.
Episode 5: "The Zorp Identity" (Mid-Season Character Episode)
A flashback episode revealing Zorp's backstory. We see him as a brilliant, arrogant scientist on his home planet, whose revolutionary ideas were suppressed by the ruling bureaucracy. His "crime" was proving the universe is not only chaotic but has a fundamentally absurd sense of humor, a truth the Federation finds destabilizing.
In the present, a Federation drone arrives to perform a routine check-up on Zorp, forcing him and Bob to create an elaborate illusion that Zorp is a "model parolee" living a quiet, productive life of exile.
Episode 6: "The Human Show"
The Threat: Bob and Zorp discover that a rival alien species has been broadcasting all of human history as a long-running, morbidly popular reality show. Ratings are slipping, and the producers are planning a "series finale": goading humanity into a spectacular nuclear war.
The Twist: The producers' methods are subtle and insidious—manipulating social media trends, political ideologies, and even personal relationships to drive conflict. Chloe discovers her own vlogging success has been secretly amplified by the producers.
Resolution & Season Finale Cliffhanger: Bob, in a moment of genuine cleverness, realizes they can't stop the broadcast, so they hijack it. He, Zorp, and Chloe produce a "clip show" episode, broadcasting humanity's most boring, mundane, and tender moments—watching paint dry, quiet family dinners, cat videos. The alien audience is so utterly bored that the show is canceled instantly. However, the enraged producers retaliate by leaking Zorp's location to his old enemies in the Federation, and a high-level "Decommissioning" ship appears in Earth's orbit as the season ends.
