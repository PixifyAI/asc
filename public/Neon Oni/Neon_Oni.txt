Neon Oni
Logline: In a rain-slicked, neon-drenched Tokyo ruled by a Yakuza clan that is secretly a coven of demonic Yokai, a disgraced enforcer, marked for death after witnessing their true forms, must partner with a cynical, tech-savvy exorcist to sever the clan's unholy pact before the mortal and spirit worlds catastrophically merge.
The Concept: Neon Oni is a high-octane, ultraviolent anime that merges the gritty underworld of a Yakuza thriller with the grotesque, imaginative horror of Japanese mythology. The animation is a slick, high-contrast blend of modern Tokyo's neon glow and the shadowy, ink-wash aesthetics of classical Japanese art. The series explores themes of tradition versus modernity, free will versus destiny, and what it means to be human in a world where the gods and monsters are real, and they’re running the criminal underworld from a skyscraper in Shinjuku.
The ruling Kageyama-kai clan's power is absolute because it's supernatural. The Oyabun (boss) is the vessel for a powerful Oni, his lieutenants are possessed by various Yokai (Tengu, Kitsune, Jorōgumo), and their influence spreads through demonic pacts, corrupting politicians, police, and corporate heads. Their hostess clubs are literal feeding grounds, where desires, luck, and life force are drained from patrons. Their "irezumi" (tattoos) are not just ink; they are living seals that bind the Yokai to their human hosts, writhing and shifting when their powers are drawn upon.
The Characters:
Kenji "The Blade" Tanaka: A low-level Kageyama-kai enforcer. A man of few words, he lives by the old codes of honor and loyalty. His skill with a katana is legendary, but his world is shattered when he discovers the monstrous secret behind the clan's power. He is cast out and hunted, a man without a purpose, forced to find a new code to live by.
Yumi "Glitch" Endo: A sharp-tongued, chain-smoking exorcist who operates out of a cramped apartment in Akihabara filled with servers and ancient scrolls. She sees the supernatural world not as something sacred, but as a system to be exploited and debugged. She uses a unique blend of Shinto ofuda (talismans) and custom-coded malware to fight Yokai, projecting digital seals and disrupting their spiritual energy. She is deeply cynical and in debt to dangerous people.
Oyabun Kageyama (The Oni): The ruthless, terrifyingly charismatic leader of the clan. In human form, he is a titan of industry. When he lets his Oni spirit loose, he becomes a hulking, unstoppable demon of brute force. He believes the pact is the next stage of human evolution, a perfect fusion of mortal ambition and demonic power.
Akane "The Fox" Kageyama: The Oyabun's wife, host to a cunning, nine-tailed Kitsune. She is the true strategist of the clan, a master of illusion, seduction, and manipulation. She can read a person's deepest desires and twist them into weapons. She sees Kenji not just as a threat, but as an interesting anomaly.
Neon Oni: Season 1 Episode Guide
Episode 1: "The Gilded Cage"
Kenji carries out a brutal but clean assassination for the Kageyama-kai, cementing his reputation as a reliable tool. He is summoned to a lavish, top-floor meeting with the clan's inner circle. The atmosphere is tense. He is ordered to execute his own captain for a perceived failure. When he hesitates, the Oyabun's rage causes his demonic form to flicker into view for a split second. Later, Kenji’s captain, in a moment of panic, reveals his own Yokai nature—a lesser Kappa demon. The clan's elite lieutenants, revealing their own monstrous forms (a winged Tengu, a spider-limbed Jorōgumo), descend and tear the captain apart. Kenji witnesses it all before being stabbed and thrown from the skyscraper window, left for dead.
Episode 2: "Digital Salt"
Miraculously surviving the fall, Kenji drags his broken body through the rain-soaked alleys of Shinjuku. He collapses at the door of the only person he knows who deals with the "weird"—a back-alley information broker who points him to Yumi. Yumi finds him bleeding out and, after a hefty down payment from a hidden stash Kenji carries, she stabilizes him with a mix of gritty first aid and mystical stitches. She is skeptical of his story until Kageyama-kai assassins, their tattoos writhing, kick down her door. Yumi defends them with a flurry of electrified ofuda and digital wards projected from her phone, revealing her unique brand of techno-exorcism.
Episode 3: "Whispers in the Wires"
Yumi explains the reality of the situation: the Kageyama-kai are not just possessed; they are "Vessels," willingly bonded with Yokai. She uses her hacking skills to dig into the clan's network, discovering their operations go far beyond simple crime. They are siphoning spiritual energy from ley lines running beneath the city. Kenji, meanwhile, struggles with the collapse of his worldview. To get answers, they track down a low-level Yakuza who deals in cursed artifacts, leading to a brutal fight in a pachinko parlor against Gaki (hungry ghosts) summoned as guards.
Episode 4: "The Silk & Spider"
Their investigation points them to a high-class hostess club in Ginza run by Akane, the Oyabun's Kitsune wife. Kenji knows the place is a trap, but it's their only lead. Yumi provides him with a "glamour-killer"—a device that disrupts illusions. Kenji enters the seductive, dream-like club. Akane personally attends to him, her illusions tempting him with promises of power and a place back in the clan. When he rejects her, she drops the facade, and the club transforms into a nightmare nest of the Jorōgumo lieutenant and her spider-children. Kenji must fight his way out of a web-filled labyrinth while Yumi remotely hacks the building's electronics to create chaos.
Episode 5: "Ghosts of the Subway"
Hunted and low on resources, the pair is forced to travel through the abandoned, ghost-infested tunnels of the old Tokyo subway system. The episode becomes a tense, claustrophobic horror story as they are stalked by the malevolent spirits of those who died there. Kenji is forced to protect Yumi, whose tech is useless against these more primal entities. They find a hidden shrine tended by an old, blind monk who reveals the origin of the Kageyama pact: it was made at a desecrated temple during the firebombing of Tokyo in WWII, a moment of immense human suffering.
Episode 6: "The Tengu's Roost"
The monk tells them the pact can be weakened by reconsecrating three key shrines in the city. The first is at the top of the Tokyo Skytree, now the personal penthouse and "roost" of Hayato, the clan's Tengu assassin. The episode is a vertical stealth-and-action set piece. Kenji and Yumi must infiltrate the heavily guarded skyscraper. The final confrontation takes place on the exterior of the building amidst a raging thunderstorm, a dizzying sword fight between Kenji and the winged Tengu.
Episode 7: "The Flesh Market"
Needing better weapons, Yumi cashes in a favor with the underworld's supernatural black market—a grotesque, hidden bazaar held in the shell of a beached container ship. Here, dealers sell cursed artifacts, bound spirits, and illegal cyber-magical hardware. They are here to acquire an "Oni-killer" blade. But they are ambushed by a rival Yakuza clan who also want the blade to stage a coup against the Kageyama-kai. This forces Kenji and Yumi into a chaotic three-way battle within the deadly market.
Episode 8: "Debt of the Nine Tails"
Akane, intrigued by Kenji's survival and sensing a shift in the supernatural balance, contacts him directly. She offers him a deal: help her overthrow her husband, the Oni, and she will ensure Kenji and Yumi can walk away. She reveals the Oni is becoming more powerful and unstable, threatening to consume the entire clan and much of the city. She sets up a meeting, but it’s a loyalty test. Kenji must choose between accepting her seductive offer of power or sticking to his new path with Yumi, leading to a brutal confrontation where her true, monstrous nine-tailed fox form is revealed.
Episode 9: "The Oni's Heart"
The second shrine is located in the heart of the Kageyama-kai's headquarters. Knowing a frontal assault is suicide, they use the chaos from Akane’s political maneuvering to infiltrate during a clan ceremony. The episode is a desperate, high-stakes heist. Yumi hacks their spiritual defenses from a remote location while Kenji navigates the building, fighting his way through his former brothers-in-arms. He reaches the shrine, but it's guarded by the Oyabun himself. Kenji is no match for the full power of the Oni and is brutally beaten.
Episode 10: "Rage Against Heaven"
Just as the Oyabun is about to kill Kenji, Yumi plays her final gambit. She overloads the city's power grid, funneling raw electricity and corrupted data directly into the shrine, momentarily stunning the Oni and severing his connection to some of his power. Kenji, battered but not broken, uses the opening. The fight is savage and desperate. He can't kill the Oni, but he manages to perform the reconsecration ritual. The backlash of sacred energy doesn't kill the Oyabun, but it critically weakens the pact across the entire clan. The season ends with Kenji and Yumi escaping into the city as a supernatural gang war erupts behind them. The Kageyama-kai is wounded but not dead, Akane is making her move for power, and every lesser Yokai in the city now knows the clan is vulnerable.
