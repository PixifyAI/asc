Projekt Absurdität
Logline:
In a war-torn Europe where a desperate Nazi regime has unleashed a zombie plague as its final, horrifying weapon, a cynical American spy must lead a ragtag team of Allied soldiers and defectors on a series of suicide missions to halt the undead apocalypse.
Series Synopsis:
Set in an alternate, darker 1944, Projekt Absurdität is an adult animated series that blends action, horror, and bleak comedy. As the Allied forces push into Germany, the war takes a gruesome and unexpected turn.[1] A fanatical sect within the Nazi high command, dabbling in the occult and fringe science, unleashes "Projekt Absurdität," a bioweapon that reanimates the dead. The result is a fast-spreading plague that turns fallen soldiers from both sides into relentless, flesh-eating zombies, throwing the war into utter chaos.
The series follows a newly-formed, off-the-books multinational squad, a "Dirty Dozen" of expendable misfits, each chosen for their unique and often morally ambiguous skills. Led by the disillusioned OSS operative Jack Riley, the team is tasked with navigating a hellish new battlefield where they must fight not only the undead but also the remaining fanatical Nazi forces who view the zombie horde as a divine superweapon. Their missions are a grim mix of espionage, search-and-destroy, and desperate survival, taking them from the haunted forests of the Ardennes to secret, subterranean Nazi labs.
Projekt Absurdität will explore the psychological toll of fighting a seemingly endless and incomprehensible enemy. The show will delve into mature themes such as the absurdity of war, the loss of humanity, and the dark humor that soldiers use to cope with trauma.[2][3] The animation style will be gritty and stylized, drawing inspiration from the propaganda posters and films of the World War II era, combined with the fluid, dynamic action of modern adult animation.[4][5]
Character Breakdowns:
Agent Jack "Smiling Jack" Riley (American OSS): The cynical, chain-smoking leader of the squad. A master of infiltration and sabotage, he uses sarcasm and gallows humor to mask the trauma of a past mission gone wrong. He's a brilliant strategist but trusts no one.
Sergeant Anya Petrova (Soviet Sniper): A stoic and lethal sniper who witnessed the first horrifying Nazi zombie experiments on the Eastern Front.[6] She is ruthlessly pragmatic and driven by a cold fury, having lost her entire family in the war.
Dr. Klaus Richter (German Defector): A guilt-ridden and cowardly German scientist who was part of Projekt Absurdität before its horrific success drove him to defect. He is the team's only hope of understanding and possibly reversing the plague, but his knowledge is fragmented and his nerve is shot.
Corporal Arthur "Artie" Finch (British Medic): The team's moral compass. A young, idealistic medic who is utterly unprepared for the horrors he now faces. He struggles to save not just lives, but the very soul of the squad, often clashing with the more cynical members.
Isabelle Dubois (French Resistance): A cunning and deadly saboteur from the French Resistance. She has a personal vendetta against the Nazi occultist behind the zombie project and operates by her own set of rules, making her both an invaluable asset and a constant liability.
Pilot Episode Outline:
Episode 1: "The Longest Night"
Act I: The Turning of the Tide
Opening: The series opens during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944.[1] The fighting is brutal and visceral. The Allies are gaining ground, pushing back a desperate German offensive. The tone is that of a classic, gritty war film.
The Incident: As Allied forces secure a German position, a series of strange SS rockets fly overhead, exploding in a sickly green mist. Soldiers caught in the blast choke and die, only to rise minutes later with unnerving speed and aggression, attacking their former comrades. The well-known Nazi zombie trope is established early on.[7] The Allied lines collapse into chaos and carnage as they are overwhelmed by the dead.
Act II: A New Kind of War
Intelligence: Agent Jack Riley, operating behind enemy lines, witnesses the outbreak and narrowly escapes. He reports the unbelievable truth to his handlers at the OSS: the Nazis have a new weapon that raises the dead.
Assembling the Squad: Faced with a threat that could lose them the war, Allied command greenlights a deniable operations unit to combat it. Jack is put in charge of recruiting a team of specialists. He pulls Anya from a holding cell (after a violent encounter with military police), is assigned the shell-shocked but experienced medic Artie, and makes a tense alliance with the unpredictable Isabelle.
The Mission: Their first objective is to infiltrate a besieged German research outpost and extract a high-value asset who has sent a desperate plea for help: Dr. Klaus Richter.
Act III: The Devil's Workshop
Infiltration: The newly formed team is airdropped near the outpost. They must navigate through a landscape teeming with the undead and avoid patrols of still-living, fanatical SS soldiers. The sequence highlights the team's conflicting methods and personalities.
The Scientist: They find the terrified Dr. Richter, who gives them a frantic, partial explanation of Projekt Absurdität. He reveals it's not just a virus; it's fueled by occult rituals and a mysterious energy source, making the zombies more than just mindless shamblers. During the rescue, they are attacked by an "Alpha" zombie—a reanimated SS officer who retains some level of tactical intelligence.
Climax and Cliffhanger: The team fights their way to the extraction point, with the intelligent Alpha zombie hot on their heels. They manage to escape by the skin of their teeth, but not before suffering their first casualty. As their transport plane flies away, they look down upon a Europe being slowly consumed by the undead horde. Richter, shivering, looks at them and says, "That was one of their early models. You haven't seen what's coming." The episode ends, setting the stage for a desperate war for the survival of humanity.
